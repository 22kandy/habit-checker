User Story: user should be able to feed unlimited task or goal options which they will try to achieve during the day and check it off in a checkbox from the list. for examplee: “Drink water”, “Meditate”, etc. The app saves the progress on a daily basis and the app gives a streak count over the period they desire to view it.
